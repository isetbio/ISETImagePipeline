## ISETImagePipeline
This repository contains all the analysis code used in our paper: An image reconstruction framework for characterizing early vision. For a 10 minutes introduction of our project, here is our [Talk](https://youtu.be/d5qI0FNCAv4) at V-VSS 2020. Feel free to contact me if you any questions or comments!

## Dependencies
This project is built upon two other repositories: [ISETBio](https://github.com/isetbio/isetbio), which is an open-source, accurate computational model for the early visual system; And our ["Reconstruction Toolbox"](https://github.com/isetbio/ISETPipelineToolbox), which is a set of routine for our Bayesian image reconstruction method.

## Get started
The best way to set up all the dependencies is to use [ToolboxToolbox](https://github.com/ToolboxHub/ToolboxToolbox), which is a MATLAB package manager. Once you set everything up, you can clone (or download) this repo to `Matlab-user-path/projects/ISETImagePipeline`. Type `tbUseProject(ISETImagePipeline)` in MATLAB, and `ToolboxToolbox` will set everything up for you!

Alternatively, you can also manually download the other two dependencies, just make sure everything is on MATLAB's search path.
